Package Mirror
##############

The vagrant files contain (where useful) a shared folder definition for
the package mirror. Create an empty directory packages.openxpki.org next
to the openxpki repository tree. This will be shared as /packages.openxpki.org
and used as source for installing the openxpki packages. 

Vagrant Machines
################
test: 
  The default test machine using debian buster 
  Grabs the current deb files from the package server/local mirror, 
  installs them using aptitude and runs the sample-setup and some of the 
  qatest.

develop:
  Installs the current packages from the repos and creates a default config
  The /code-repo tree is shared with the host, change code on the host 
  machine and use scripts/deploy.sh inside the guest to copy it over to 
  the actual code base.
